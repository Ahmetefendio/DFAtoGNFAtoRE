# DFAtoGNFAtoRE

This program is responsible for converting Deterministic finite automaton to regular expression. The program creates a DFA from a text file. Text files should include start state, accept state/states, states, alphabet and transitions respectively. After reading the file the program generates a transition function and prints the DFA. To obtain the regular expression, the program converts DFA to GNFA and then GNFA  to a regular expression step by step. All steps are printed on the screen.
